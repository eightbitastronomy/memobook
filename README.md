# memobook

A notepad/texteditor derivative for people who don't want to remember everything ever.
 -   If you commonly write down things you've learned in plain text files -- because there's just too much to remember --
 -   ...and months later you need that information but can't remember where you wrote it down...
 -   Then sure, you could grep your home directory to death. Or, this is the application for you.

Memobook:
 -   Can display image and pdf files too (read-only) with basic functionality (zooming, rotating, etc.).
 -   Stores information (your bookmarks) about the image & pdf files without altering them.
 -   Written in Python 3; requires tkinter, sqlite3, pillow, and poppler libraries. Pillow (PIL) version 6+ (I think) -- must have ImageTk.
 -   A work in progress.
