# memobook
A notepad/texteditor derivative for people who don't want to remember everything ever.
- Write notes as you go, but store them as .txt text files. At the end of your file, type up a few "marks" which basically serve to hashtag your file. Use the tag-marker designated in config.py. Example, for "@@": @@readme @@help @@memobook
- Yes, certainly on a -nix system you could just grep particular keywords. But why do we continue to code and code and code if not to make tasks easier than they were before?
- Written in Python 3; requires tkinter and sqlite3 libraries.
- A work in progress.
