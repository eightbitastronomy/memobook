USAGE                                         *memobook*

:Mclear               Clear the marks database. Does not clear silent
                      mark index.

:Mwrite [file]        Write buffer. If buffer has no name, will fail
                      with error.

:Medit[!] [marks]     Load files into buffers based on marks listed.
                      Search terms are ORed together unless ! is used,
		      in which case terms are ANDed together.

:Medita               Load files based on visual selection. Behaves
                      similarly to |:Medit|

:Mmark[!]             Insert mark-tags into visually-selected text.
		      Presence of ! invokes |:Msil| behavior.

:Msil                 Add silent marks to the current buffer based on
                      visually-selected text. Duplicate marks will not
		      be added. Silent marks are not written to the
		      database or to the index until |:Mwrite| is
		      called.

:Msild                Display silent marks for the current buffer.

:Msilm                Manage silent marks for the current buffer.
		      Silent marks are not written to the
		      database or to the index until |:Mwrite| is
		      called.

:Mscan                Scan specified directories for marked files.
		      To set specified directories, see |:Mscanm|.

:Mscanm               Manage directories for scanning.

MAPPINGS                                     *memobook-mappings*

Memobook uses |<Leader>m| following by a single keystroke for quick
access to several functionalities. In normal mode:

e                     Edit (any), or |:Medit|. User will be prompted for marks.

E                     Edit (all), or |:Medit!|. User will be prompted for
		      marks.

s		      Manage silent marks, or |:Msilm|.

w                     Write buffer, or |:Mwrite|.

And in visual mode:

e                     Edit (any), or |:Medita|.

E		      Edit (all), or |:Medita!|.

m                     Insert marks into text, or |:Mmark|

s		      Insert silent marks, or |:Msil|.

w                     Write buffer, or |:Mwrite|.

CONFIGURATION                                 *memobook-config*

Configuration of Memobook can be done in an automated way via config.sh
bash script provided with the suite, or can be done by hand by editing
the plugin source files. Use of config.sh is encouraged, as one of the
primary goals of the Memobook Note Suite is ease of use: by tying 
together functionalities over several preexisting applications, a user
can store and retrieve notes without being constrained to a single
mode of use, such as to a sticky-notes app. With this is mind, there
are some manual edits to this plugin that will not affect the overall
Suite interoperability (e.g., changing the mappings).

CHANGELOG                                    *memobook-changes*

Version 1.2           Redesign of user interface. Addition of 
                      documentation. Addition of visual-mode functions.
