Emacs interface to Memobook functionality:



Memobook-mode is loaded as a minor mode upon visiting a text file. It may be enabled or disabled in
the usual way, i.e., by Alt-x memobook-mode. 



The following table describes interface calls and keystrokes.



Keystroke       Name (use with Alt-x)   Function 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alt-m m         mb-readmarks-or         Find file by mark, OR (union of marks). See 
                                         Find/Region, below.
Alt-m Ctrl-m    mb-readmarks-and        Find file by mark, AND (intersection of marks. 
                                         See Find/Region, below.
Alt-m n         mb-silentmark-add       Add silent mark for current buffer. See 
                                         Find/Region, below.
Alt-m Ctrl-n    mb-silentmark-manage    Select marks to be added or removed from current 
                                         buffer's silent marks.
Alt-m c         mb-source-clear         Clear memobook database of entries.
Alt-m s         mb-source-scan          Scan each source directory for files containing
                                         bookmarks.
Alt-m Ctrl-s    mb-source-manage        Select directories to be added or removed from
                                         current buffer's scan directories.
Alt-m w         mb-write-marks          Write marks for current buffer without saving 
                                         the current buffer. See reading and writing.

Find/Region functions:
    Several functions behave differently depending on the position of the cursor, (aka, point).
      1. If nothing lies beneath the point and no region is selected, the user will be prompted for input.
      2. If a word lies beneath the point, this word will be used as input.
      3. If a region is highlighted, i.e., marked, then the region will be used as input.
    Because of this behavior, if the user wishes to enter input manually, calling the function by name
is preferable. At any time, Alt-x <function-name> will call the function with the behavior of #1 above.



Reading and writing of marks:
    Each visited file has its own buffer-local information. Alteration of, e.g., silent marks in one 
buffer will not affect silent marks in another. That said, upon reading a file into an Emacs buffer,
no bookmark information is loaded. Such information is loaded ad-hoc, or, as needed. Hence, silent marks
are loaded the first time a silent-mark function is called.
    When a file is saved (while memobook-mode is enabled of course), the file is searched for bookmarks
according to the @@ tag. (TO-DO: allow different tags). Silent marks and open marks are compared with 
the database and index files, and changes are written. If Emacs says a file is unmodified and therefore
will not call a save-hook, then no mark information will be written to the database or index. Hence, call
mb-write-marks.
    If a file is loaded via memobook function (such as mb-readmarks-or), the buffer is not made current.
In other words, files are loaded into other buffers, and the user must switch to them.
    Function mb-write-marks only operates on the current buffer. However, if the current buffer has no
associated file, the function will fail silently.
